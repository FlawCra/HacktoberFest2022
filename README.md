# HacktoberFest2022

This repository will automatically assign the `hacktoberfest` and `hacktoberfest-accepted` labels to all submitted pull requests.

**NEW THIS YEAR: This repository will also automatically merge your code after assigning the labels.**

**NOTE: We can revert your PR, so don't abuse it!**

**Please do not abuse this system as you will be disqualified anyway.**

This repository is meant to simplify the process of assigning the labels, as many other repos have taken a lot of time to do this.

We hope you submit some kind of useful code to this repository.

The format for submitting code is:
`Your programming language name`/`function name.extension`
(If the folder doesn't exist yet, please go ahead and create it)
